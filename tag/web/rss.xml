	     <p>Some thoughts on JWT authentication in a React App.</p>

<p>I am relatively new to React, I started writing React in September 2019. Having watched a 1-hour crash course on YouTube, I found React to be one of the easiest frontend framework to pick up, especially when compared to Angular.</p>

<p>I have gotten used to using React for every personal project I build for web. However, recently, I have a project that grew a bit bigger and I was using JWT for authentication. I must admit, I have very little implementational experience regarding JWT and JWT in React. My inital approach was simple, and works for small-scale apps. I would simply check for the presence of a JWT token in every protected component, via a lifecycle method, e.g. useEffect() or componentDidMount().</p>

<p>This very quickly revealed its flaws, each additional component that requires authentication will require the same (repeated) code, which violates the DRY principle. A bit of reading and I found that the authentication logic can be abstracted by simply wrapping a Route in a closure and performing the auth logic within, with a redirect to a landing page if user is not authenticated.</p>

<p>I have yet to try it out, but it is quite straightforward and clear that it will work.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">to</span> <span class="nx">insert</span> <span class="nx">some</span> <span class="nx">sample</span> <span class="nx">code</span> <span class="nx">here</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Rather, I was thinking, for a SPA, regardless of what authentication method is being used. The user <em>can</em> actually bypass whatever mechanism is being used, as the logic is completely client-sided. Of course, this might not be an issue, since each endpoint should authenticate the JWT as well. My thoughts are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is there a way around it, to prevent user from being able to <em>view</em> protected pages by spoofing a JWT.</li>
  <li>Is it a problem that a user could potentially do the above.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just to be clear, by spoofing, I really mean an invalid JWT which would fail in server-sided verification but should pass in client-sided checks since the only way the client can check would be to have the secret as well, but it will defeat the purpose of JWT.</p>
