	     <p>This blog is done in Jekyll. Which is why it seems only fitting to have the first post about Jekyll.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I had never heard of Jekyll until I googled for static site generators. What drew my attention was the fact that it’s written in Ruby. Having used Ruby on Rails before, I wanted to see the difference/similarities between Jekyll and RoR. I didn’t really know what to expect since I have never used a static site generator. But I had some baseline expectations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write markdown</li>
  <li>Parse it into html</li>
</ol>

<p>Jekyll met and exceeded my expectations. It somehow organizes all my posts and tags, allowing for easy searching and navigation. I have to dig more into how it’s implemented and the magic behind it. Color me impressed.</p>
